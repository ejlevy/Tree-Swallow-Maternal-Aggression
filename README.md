# Tree-Swallow-Social-Challenge-During-Incubation

This repository contains the code and data used for the analysis of "Brain transcriptomics of a social challenge and maternal aggression in incubating female tree swallows"

1. Raw counts (RNAseq data) for both brain regions, along with gene information about each transcript: rawCounts.dSBN.xlsx & rawCounts.vSBN.xlsx, Gene Info.xlsx
2. Code to rerun Deseq2 analysis: Incubation aggression Deseq2 script.R
3. Code to rerun circulating testosterone analyses: Circulating testosterone analysis.R
4. Code to recreate all figures: Incubation aggression code for all plots.R
5. Data to easily recreate all plots (pulled from various sources, nice to have it all together in one document): Data frames for figures.xlsx
6. Code and knitted html file of in silico experiment testing shorter read length: In silico shorter read analysis.Rmd & In silico shorter read analysis.html
7. Data for in silico experiment testing shorter read length: delta.NT.trans.xlsx 

Additional data files are included as supplements to the manuscript iteslf:
1. Trait data (Appendix B), which is needed for deseq2 and circulating testosterone scripts
2. Appendix A is a pdf with supplemental information
3. Appendix C is a list of all the differentially expressed genes in the study
4. Appendix D is the results of gene enrichment analyses
